 What I've learned so far
==========================

This is a current tally of stuff I've learned so far.

-----------------------------------
 Terminal Commands for Linux/MacOS
-----------------------------------

pwd - print working directory
hostname - my computer's network name
env - look at your environment
export - export/set a new environment variable
mkdir - make directory
cd - change directory
ls - list directory
rmdir - remove directory 
pushd - push directory
popd - pop directory
cp - copy a file or directory
mv - move a file or directory
less - page through a file 
cat - print a whole file
echo - print some arguments
xargs - execute arguments
find - find files
grep - find things inside files
man - read manual page
apropros - find which man page is appropriate
exit - exit the shell
sudo - become root user

------------------
 Exercise 1 and 2
------------------
- print()
- # comments
- running .py files from the terminal

print("This is a string that gets printed to the terminal")

# <-- this symbol is called an octothorpe
# anything typed after the octothorpe becomes a comment
# comments get ignored
# comments are useful for describing what a line of code does or what a certain variable is, etc.

# to run a .py file, type this in the terminal --> python3 file_name.py

# alternatively you can type and enter python3 to start python shell
# then you type exec(open("file_name.py").read())
# to quit the python shell, type and enter quit()

------------
 Exercise 3
------------

- math

+ this does addition
- this does subtraction
* this does multiplication
/ this does division, and gives you a floating number
// this also does floor division, and rounds down the result to the nearest integer
% this is a modulus, and it gives the remainder from a division
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= more than or equal to
