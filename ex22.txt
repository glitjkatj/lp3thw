 What I've learned so far
==========================

This is a current tally of stuff I've learned so far.

-----------------------------------
 Terminal Commands for Linux/MacOS
-----------------------------------

pwd - print working directory
hostname - my computer's network name
env - look at your environment
export - export/set a new environment variable
mkdir - make directory
cd - change directory
ls - list directory
rmdir - remove directory 
pushd - push directory
popd - pop directory
cp - copy a file or directory
mv - move a file or directory
less - page through a file 
cat - print a whole file
echo - print some arguments
xargs - execute arguments
find - find files
grep - find things inside files
man - read manual page
apropros - find which man page is appropriate
exit - exit the shell
sudo - become root user

------------------
 Exercise 1 and 2
------------------
- print()
- # comments
- running .py files from the terminal

print("This is a string that gets printed to the terminal")

# <-- this symbol is called an octothorpe
# anything typed after the octothorpe becomes a comment
# comments get ignored
# comments are useful for describing what a line of code does or what a certain variable is, etc.

# to run a .py file, type this in the terminal --> python3 file_name.py

# alternatively you can type and enter python3 to start python shell
# then you type exec(open("file_name.py").read())
# to quit the python shell, type and enter quit()

------------
 Exercise 3
------------

- math

+ this does addition
- this does subtraction
* this does multiplication
/ this does division, and gives you a floating number
// this also does floor division, and rounds down the result to the nearest integer
% this is a modulus, and it gives the remainder from a division
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= more than or equal to
== this checks if two objects are equal

------------
 Exercise 4
------------

- variables

variables are containers for storing data values
they're names you give to some value
you assign value to a variable using a single equal sign
some_variable = <data type value>

so, there's a difference between what single equal and double equal do 

------------
 Exercise 5
------------

- strings
- embedding variables in f strings

a string is some text you put in single or double quotes
to put variables in some text you can use an f string, or formatted string

some sample code to illustrate this:

name = "Thanos"
age = 1000

# the string is preceded by an f
# inside the string, the variables are put inside curly braces
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.") 

------------
 Exercise 6
------------

- format()

here's another way to print a string with embedded values
nb: the values that go into the curly braces aren't actually named variables

print("My name is {} and I am {} years old".format("Thanos", 1000))

------------
 Exercise 7
------------

- more string stuff

you can repeat the printing of a character with multiplication
print("-" * 10)

if you need a space between words, that can be done a few ways
print("Samurai " + "Jack")
print("Samurai" + " Jack")
print("Samurai" + " " + "Jack")

------------
 Exercise 8
------------

- more on format()

formatted_string = "{} {} {} {}"

#the values passed in the parentheses are printed where the curly braces are
#they're also arranged in order
print(formatted_string.format("one", "two", "three", "four"))
print(formatted_string.format(1, 2, 3, 4))
print(formatted_string.format(True, True, False, True))
