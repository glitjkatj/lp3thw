 Exercise 1 and 2
------------------

print("This is a string that gets printed to the terminal")

# <-- this symbol is called an octothorpe
# anything typed after the octothorpe becomes a comment
# comments get ignored
# comments are useful for describing what a line of code does or what a certain variable is, etc.
# to run a .py file, type this in the terminal --> python3 file_name.py
